# Our Goal

We wanted the  security-testing to become an integrated part of our development. And by doing that move it earlier in the development cycle. 

To make sure it would be a natural part of the development we wanted to move into the delivery pipeline as an automated job. 

Our security experts recommended [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp/) as the best tool available for the job and this is the reason why we selected this over [OWASP ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project).
