# Known Issues & Limitations

## Limitations
* Manual configuration is still required
    * What to proxy - scope
    * Getting the state
    * Adding false positives
    * Login macro
* Takes quite some time to run the scan
    * What to proxy - scope
    * Belongs in the nightly build
* Not a silver bullet..
    * The point of using a tool and automation, is to scale and enforce policy. You also have to embed security in your development work, educate yourself so that you can plug those security holes before they emerge. 
    
## Known Issues
* I am sure there are many :stuck_out_tongue:
* TODO: Find and list them here
